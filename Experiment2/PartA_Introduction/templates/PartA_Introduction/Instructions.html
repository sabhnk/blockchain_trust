    This study consists of an experiment and a survey. All necessary instructions will be displayed here on the screen.
    <br />
    <br />

    <b>Experiment</b>
    <br />
    <br />


    You are going to participate in a financial exchange game. The currency used is ECU (Experimental Currency Unit).

    <br />
    The exchange rate is as follows.
    <br />
    <br />
    1 ECU = {{session.real_world_currency_per_point}} €
    <br />
    <br />

    You are divided into two groups, A and B. Then each participant is randomly assigned a partner from the other group.
    Player A starts with a specified amount. From this amount he can send a part x to his partner from group B.
    It is possible to send any amount between zero and the total amount.
    This amount is tripled by the experimenter and passed on to player B.
    Player B now decides which part of the tripled amount he sends back to A.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    The transaction would take place exclusively between you and your partner from the other participant group.
    The only influence from outside would come from the experimenter in tripling the amount.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />

    {% if participant.vars.transparent_PartA %}
        Each participant gets a pseudonym, which they keep throughout the whole experiment.
        The transaction takes place on a public blockchain network.
        This means that transaction details of you and all other participants,
        such as the pseudonyms of the sender and recipient, amount and time of the transaction
        are <b>publicly visible and permanently stored</b>.
        <br />
        <br />

        <br />

    {% else %}
        Your transaction details will only be visible for you and your transaction partner.
        <br />
    {% endif %}

    <br />
    <br />
    <br />

    <b>Pay-Out</b>
    <br />
    <br />
    Your pay-out only depends on your decision and the decision of your partner.
    <br />
    <br />
    <u>Player A</u>: Initial amount – amount sent to B + amount received back from B
    <br />
    <u>Player B</u>: Initial amount + triple the amount sent from A – amount sent back to A
    <br />


    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    For the further course of the experiment it is necessary that you have understood the setting.
    Therefore, <b>if you answer the following questions wrong</b>, you will <b>not be able to continue participating</b> in the experiment and <b>will not receive a payout</b>.
    <br />
    Please read carefully.
