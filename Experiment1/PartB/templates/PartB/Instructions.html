During this study we will describe a hypothetical situation and kindly ask you to complete a corresponding questionnaire.
    <br />
Your payoff for this study is fixed. It is only reduced if you answer the confirmatory questions incorrectly.
Since the situation described within this study is a hypothetical situation, it will not affect your payoff.
Nevertheless, put yourself in the described situation and answer the corresponding questionnaire (on the following pages) accordingly.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />

    <b>Description of situation</b>
    <br />
    <br />

    Imagine the following situation.
    <br />
    <br />

    You have the opportunity to participate in a financial exchange game.
    The currency used is ECU (Experimental Currency Unit).
    <br />
    The exchange rate is as follows.
    <br />
    <br />
    1 ECU = ${{session.real_world_currency_per_point}}
    <br />
    <br />

    All participants are divided into two groups, A and B.
    Then each participant is randomly assigned a partner from the other group.
    <br />
    At the beginning Player A is granted a specified initial amount.
    From this amount Player A can send a part to his partner from group B.
    It is possible to choose any amount between zero and the total amount.
    This amount is tripled by the experimenter and passed on to Player B.
    Player B now decides which part of the tripled amount he sends back to Player A.
    <br />
    <br />
    The transactions would take place exclusively between you and your partner from the other participant group.
    The only influence from outside would come from the experimenter in tripling the amount.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />

    {% if participant.vars.transparent_PartB %}
        Each participant gets a pseudonym, which they keep throughout the whole experiment.
        The transaction takes place on a public blockchain network.
        This means that transaction details of you and all other participants,
        such as the pseudonyms of the sender and recipient, amount and time of the transaction
        are <b>publicly visible and permanently stored</b>.
        <br />
        <br />

        <br />

    {% else %}
        Your transaction details would only be visible for you and your transaction partner.
        <br />
    {% endif %}

    <br />
    <br />
    <br />

<!--    <b>Payoff</b>
    <br />
    <br />-->
    Your payoff would depend on your decision and the decision of your partner.
    <br />
    <br />
    <u>Player A</u>: Initial amount – amount sent to Player B + amount received back from Player B
    <br />
    <u>Player B</u>: Initial amount + triple the amount sent from Player A – amount sent back to Player A
    <br />


    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <b>Confirmatory Questions</b>
    <br />
    <br />
    For the further course of the experiment it is necessary that you have understood the situation described above.
    Therefore, <b>if you answer the following questions wrong</b>, you will <b>not be able to continue participating</b> in the experiment and <b>your payoff will be reduced</b>.
